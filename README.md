## Objective
Our objective is to:
* Understand the data and get valuable insights from it.
* Use various Supervised Learning techniques to create a Machine Learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a person has Heart Disease or not based on various medical attributes(Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, etc).

## Code and Resources used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages used: Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pickle and Streamlit.
* Data: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

* The web application is created using the ***Streamlit*** library and deployed using the ***Heroku*** platform.

* The application can be viewed at the link mentioned below.
